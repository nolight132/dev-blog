# Blog Update: MDX parsing ‚ú®
I wasn't really planning to write about the blog itself, but I need to test the MDX parsing, so here we are.

## The idea
When I first thought about starting this blog, I knew I wanted all the posts to be written in Markdown.
The idea was to keep the process of writing and publishing as simple as possible, which for me meant
it had to happen in a local text editor. I also wanted the pages automatically generating upon creation
of an `.md` file. So here I am now writing this post in [Zed](https://zed.dev/). üòÅ

## Next.js and MDX
I have been using Next.js for a while now in my [Movie Browser](https://github.com/nolight132/movie-browser)
project, and I liked its directory-based routing system. That's exactly what I wanted in my blog, so I decided to
use Next.js for this project as well. That's how I ended up with `next-mdx-remote`, a package that allows
me to render MDX files as React components. It turns out it has a lot of useful plugins, like `remark-slug`
and `remark-autolink-headings`, which I'm using to generate the anchor links next to the headings.
I also added a custom component for the code blocks with [Ros√© Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com) theme,
which I think looks pretty good.

That's how easy it is to render an MDX file in Next.js:
```tsx
const Post = async ({
	params,
}: {
	params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
}) => {
	const { slug } = await params;
	const { meta, content } = getPostBySlug(slug);

	return (
		<article className="prose dark:prose-invert md:prose-lg lg:prose-xl w-full">
			<p className="text-muted-foreground">{meta.date}</p>
			<MDXRemote
				source={content}
				options={options}
				components={{
					pre: CodeBlock,
				}}
			/>
		</article>
	);
};
```
## Roadmap
Now that I can write posts in Markdown, I'm planning to add a tag system and a search functionality, but that's for another post. üòÑ
