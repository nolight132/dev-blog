# Hello World! üåç
**This is the first post on my new blog!** I've been getting a lot of inspiration lately and I thought it would be a
good idea to start writing things down. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing!

## Why a blog?
I just felt like it. It was one of those impulsive decisions that I make, but **this** time I'm sticking with it. At least for now...
Jokes aside, I think it's a good way to keep track of the progress I'm making as I keep taking up more and more projects.
Also, I've decided to code this website from scratch, and although it lacks functionality, I have put a non-zero amount of effort
into it, which (I hope) will make me more likely to keep writing.

## Who am I, anyway?
I am a first-year CS student, although I have been into computers and coding for the most part of my life. I have a few
[projects](https://github.com/nolight132), most of them ongoing at the time of writing. The biggest one for me yet is
[Mazing Engine](https://github.com/nolight132/mazing-engine), a terminal-based ASCII 3D renderer for mazes, which is something I have been wanting to do for a long time.
So, I think it's safe to assume that I'm into graphics at this point.


## What's next?
Well, I have a couple of ongoing projects, so I think I'll write about them next. I also have a few ideas for new projects, as I
want to dive deeper into Rust and graphics programming. Yes, I am going to make yet another Rust game engine at some point... So what?
It's fun! It's a great exercise as well. But, until then, let's stick to C for the renderer, and TypeScript for the website.

That's it for now. Bye!
